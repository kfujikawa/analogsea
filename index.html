<!-- Respect any widths and heights indicated in the annotated design file.
*AnalogSea's logo appears at the top of the page. 
*The form should post to the url /signup/ when the user submits it.
*The email and password fields are both required.
*The form should validate the email field for a valid email address.
*The "forgot password" link should point to /forgot-password/new.
*The login link should point to /login.
*The logo and form should be horizontally centered, and have a height of 75px, as indicated in the design. Although the source file has a height of 111px, use CSS to set its height to 35px.
Stretch feature: When the user hovers over the submit button, it should transition to a darker shade of green.
The page should be SEO and accessibility friendly. That means including a title and description in the head of the document, and using labels with their for attribute set on the form. -->
